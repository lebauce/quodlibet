    GStreamer pipeline before the audio sink and after the playbin.

    The method setup_element should return a new element instance or None:
        self.setup_element()

    One optional method can be implemented:
        self.update_element(element)

    update_element should apply all settings and will be called after
    queue_update or on pipeline creation etc.

    To notify setting changes, call queue_update.
