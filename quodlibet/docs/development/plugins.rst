Plugin Development
==================

A Quod Libet / Ex Falso Plugin is a simple python module or package which 
contains sub-classes of special plugin classes and is placed anywhere in 
``~/.quodlibet/plugins`` so it can be found by QL. These classes can provide 
special methods that get used by QL or can take action on certain events.

At the moment the following plugin classes exist:

Plugin Types
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Event Plugins
    * Are instantiated as long as they are enabled or QL is running. They get
      notified when songs start, get added etc.
    * Example: Last.fm scrobbler that watches what you play and sends the 
      information to last.fm.

Tag Editing Plugins
    * Can extend many parts of the tag editor.
    * Example: Title case your tags.

GStreamer Plugins
    * Can inject elements into the GStreamer pipeline and configure them on the 
      fly.
    * Example: Tempo adjustment to play music/audio books faster.

Play Order Plugins
    * Can decide which song to play next or what happens if you select one. 
    * Example: Follow cursor, which plays the selected song next.

Songs Menu Plugins
    * Can be accessed through the play list context menu and get passed all 
      selected songs.
    * Example: Album art search, to search album art for all selected songs.

Playlist Plugins
    * Similar to Songs Menu plugin, and in fact derived on the same base class
    * Can be accessed through the playlist context menu in the
      :ref:`Playlist Browser <Playlists>`
    * Example: remove duplicate songs from a playlist.

Cover Source Plugins
    * Fetch covers from external or local resources


Creating a new Plugin
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Create a file ``myplugin.py`` and place it under ``~/.quodlibet/plugins`` 
   (create the folder if needed)

#. Write the following into the file::

    from quodlibet.plugins.events import EventPlugin

    class MyPlugin(EventPlugin):
        PLUGIN_ID = "myplugin"
        PLUGIN_NAME = _("My Plugin")

#. Restart Quod Libet

#. In Quod Libet open ``Music`` â‡’ ``Plugins`` and search the list for "My 
   Plugin"


Tips:
~~~~~

* The best way to find out what is possible is to read the documentation of 
  the `plugin base classes
  <https://bitbucket.org/lazka/quodlibet/src/default/quodlibet/quodlibet/plugins>`_ .

* The easiest way to get started creating a new plugin is to look for `existing plugins
  <https://bitbucket.org/lazka/quodlibet/src/default/quodlibet/quodlibet/ext/>`_ that do 
  something similar to what you want.
