Quod Libet uses `GTK+ <http://www.gtk.org/>`_, because GTK+ makes it easy

uses `Python <http://www.python.org/>`_, because Python makes it easy to
create clean, simple functional and object-oriented software. Various other

Using the `Mutagen <http://code.google.com/p/mutagen/>`_ tagging library
keeps the rest of Quod Libet as simple as possible and ensures every
tag in your music library is available for your searching pleasure.
