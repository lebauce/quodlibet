File System Browser
-------------------

This browser lets you view songs based on the folder they're in. It can 
play and edit songs inside and outside of your song library, and adds an 
item to the context menu to add the selected songs to your library. If you 
try to add songs to a playlist or the play queue that aren't in your 
library, they will be added automatically to it.

.. note::

    Since ratings and play counts are usually stored in the library 
    rather than the song, play counts and ratings will only be saved if you add 
    the song to your library!
