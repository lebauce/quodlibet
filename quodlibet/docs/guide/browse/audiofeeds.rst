Audio Feeds Browser
-------------------

The *Audio Feeds* browser allows you to subscribe to syndicated feeds with 
attached audio files; these are often called "podcasts" or "blogcasts." 
Feeds are automatically checked for updates every two hours, and bolded if 
new entries are found.

You can right-click on a file in an audio feed, and select *Download*, to 
download it to your hard drive. Currently this has no effect on the feed 
itself (so changes to the local song will not be reflected in the feed list).
