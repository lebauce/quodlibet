Search Browser
--------------

The *Search Library* browser (which is the default one) lets you enter 
search terms and play all matching songs. It also supports 
:ref:`complex searches <Searching>`. Finally, it lets you 
limit the number of results; right-click on the text bar and select *Limit 
Results*. To display your whole library, don't enter any search terms.

The browser remembers the last eight searches you made automatically. If 
you want to save more, you can right-click on the text entry and select 
*Edit Saved Values...*, which will let you name and save searches 
permanently. Saved searches will appear above automatically remembered ones 
in the menu.
