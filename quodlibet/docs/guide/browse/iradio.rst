Internet Radio Browser
----------------------

This browser lets you listen to Internet radio stations (a.k.a. streaming 
audio or Shoutcast). It supports MP3 and Ogg Vorbis streaming, and may 
support other formats (AAC or RealMedia) if you have appropriate GStreamer 
plugins installed. *New Station* accepts either a direct URL to a stream, 
or a URL to a ``.pls`` file with a list of streams.

Radio stations cannot be added to playlists or the play queue. You can edit 
the ``title``, ``artist``, and ``grouping`` tags, but the rest are filled 
in by the station when you listen.

If you don't know any good stations, the *Stations...* button will let you 
select some. If you do know some good stations, you can add them to the 
Stations list.
